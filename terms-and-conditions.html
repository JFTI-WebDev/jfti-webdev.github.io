                        <span>If this order is placed under a Government prime contract or a federally-funded order, the following provisions set forth in both the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) in effect within the prime contract associated with this order, are hereby incorporated in this order with the exception of commercial products or commercial services. Where necessary to make the context of these provisions applicable to this order, the term “contractor” shall mean “seller”, the term “contract” shall mean “this order”, and the terms “Government”, “Contracting Officer”, and equivalent phrases shall mean “buyer”. If the buyer has approved lower-tier subcontracting, the seller shall include the appropriate FAR and DFAR flow-down clauses in lower-tier subcontracts.</span>
                        <hr />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">1. Inspection/Acceptance</span>
                        <p>The seller shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this order. The buyer reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The buyer may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. The buyer must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Government may engage in the same inspection activities as J.F. Taylor, Inc.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">2. Assignment</span>
                        <p>The seller or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C.3727).</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">3. Changes</span>
                        <p>Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">4. Disputes</span>
                        <p>This order is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. -7101-7109). Failure of the parties to this order to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this order shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The seller shall proceed diligently with performance of this order, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the order. Except as may be expressly set forth in this T&C document with the Government Contracting Officer’s express consent, the seller shall not acquire any direct claim or direct course of action against the U.S. Government. The parties agree that the U.S. Federal Court shall be the venue if any dispute arises between parties.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">5. Definitions</span>

                        <p>The seller shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the seller and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The seller shall notify the buyer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the buyer of the cessation of such occurrence.</p>
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">9. Payment</span>
                        <p>Payment shall be made for items accepted by the buyer that have been delivered to the delivery destinations set forth in this order.</p>

                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">10. Risk of Loss</span>

                        <p>The buyer reserves the right to terminate this order, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the seller shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this order, the seller shall be paid a percentage of the order price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the seller can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the buyer using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The seller shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the buyer any right to audit the seller’s records. The seller shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">13. Termination for Cause</span>
                        <p>The buyer may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the seller, or if the seller fails to comply with any order terms and conditions, or fails to provide the buyer, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the buyer shall not be liable to the seller for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the seller shall be liable to the buyer for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the buyer improperly terminated this order for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">14. Title</span>

                        <p>In the event that one or more provisions of this order is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions apply in full and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a provision that lawfully enforces the Parties’ intention underlying the invalid of unenforceable provision.</p>
                        <br />
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">19. Export Control</span>

                        <p>(b) Seller agrees to notify Buyer if any deliverable under this order is restricted by export control laws or regulations.</p>
                        <p>(c) If seller is engaged in the business of either exporting or manufacturing (whether exporting or not) defense articles or furnishing defense services, seller represents that it is registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls, as required by the ITAR, and it maintains an effective export/import compliance program in accordance with the ITAR.</p>
                        <p>(d) Seller shall be responsible for all losses, costs, claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, all expenses of litigation and/or settlement, and court costs arising from any act or omission of seller, its officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or subcontractors at any tier, in the performance of any of its obligations under this clause.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <span>General: As a supplier to J.F. Taylor, Inc. (JFTI), you become a key contributor to the products and services that we deliver to our customers.

                        <span>5.
